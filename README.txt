How to run:
- run 'make' to compile the project
- run 'java main' to run the executable that runs the tests for various input sizes
- the output of the segments generated and intersections reported for each test will
be stored in a file called "IntersectionsFornSegments.txt"
- run 'make clean' to delete all of the .class files and text output files
- repeat steps if desired
